# terminal-notifier-bridge-for-email-notifications
This is a MacOS BASH script designed to receive information from Thunderbird plugins such as Mailbox Alerts or FiltaQuilla's "Run Application" action and use it to display custom notifications for incoming emails. The notification can be clicked to open the email directly if a working message URI is provided.
